OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    7Zip Ingest Module\n\nThe 7Zip ingest module processes archive files (such as zip and others archive types supported by the 7zip extractor).\n\
    Contents of the archives are extracted and the derived files are added back to the current ingest to be processed by the configured ingest modules.\n\
    If the derived file happens to be an archive file, it will be re-processed by the 7zip extractor - the extractor will process archive files N-levels deep.\n\n\
    The extracted files are navigable in the directory tree.\n\n\
    The module is supported on Windows, Linux and Mac operating systems.
